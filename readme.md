# Dijkstra`s algorithm visualiser

This is just a fun tool to visualise how Dijkstra`s algorithm works.

## The algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm allows us to find the shortest distance between any two nodes on a graph. But how does it work?

### What is a directed graph?

A `directed graph` is simply a graph with `edges` connecting `nodes` that can be one way, meaning that you can traverse along them towards a node but not back. This can lead to some interesting problems, an example of a directed graph is below:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="./images/graph.png" alt="Graph" />
  <p style="text-align: center;">A directed graph with 5 nodes.</p>
</div>
